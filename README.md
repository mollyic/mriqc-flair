# FLAIR support for MRIQC

This repository extends the standard [MRIQC](https://github.com/poldracklab/mriqc) framework to support quality control and conversion workflows for 3D **FLAIR** MRI sequences. This code is the original pipeline used to generate the work at OHBM, it is based on the version 23.1.0 of the MRIQC pipeline.

## Overview

As a common scan in clinical and research settings, this project was undertaken to extend the quantitative assessments of scan quality using the MRIQC framework for FLAIR. This project introduces:

- **FLAIR-specific image handling** added to core workflows
- Inclusion of FLAIR images in outputted MRQIC **quality control (QC) reports**

## How to Use

Running works the same as the original MRIQC â€” FLAIR files must follow BIDS naming conventions e.g. `sub-01_ses-01_FLAIR.nii.gz`

## Docker

### Build the Docker Container

Before running, you need to build the custom MRIQC Docker container. From the root of the project, run:

```bash
docker build -t mriqc-flair .
```
#### Run the participant level in subjects 001, 002, and 003:

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -v <bids_dir>:/data:ro \
  -v <output_dir>:/out \
  mriqc-flair \
  /data /out participant --participant_label 001 002 003
```

#### Run the group level and report generation on previously processed subjects:

```bash
docker run -it --rm \
  -v <bids_dir>:/data:ro \
  -v <output_dir>:/out \
  mriqc-flair \
  /data /out group
```

> **Note:** If the `--participant_label` argument is not provided, then all BIDS-compliant subjects will be processed and the group-level analysis will automatically be executed without needing to run the group command separately.

---

### Run MRIQC from a Local Development Environment

If you are running MRIQC from a local Python environment with FLAIR support added (e.g., via `pip install -e .`), run:

```bash
python3 -m mriqc.cli.run /path/to/bids_dataset /path/to/output participant \
  --modalities FLAIR \
  --no-sub
```
> Note: You must have AFNI, ANTs, and FSL installed and accessible in your $PATH for MRIQC to run correctly outside of the Docker container.

## Acknowledgements

This extension builds on the incredible work of the [MRIQC team](https://mriqc.readthedocs.io). FLAIR support was inspired by QC needs for the growing multisite cohort in the Australian Epilepsy Project.
